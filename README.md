- 👋 Hi, I’m @sciartmanoelab Immunology and Inflammation Master student at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, UFRJ - Brazil. I'm a newbie, science enthusiast, fast thinking person with slow time-breaks to refresh my brain system. Each day I'm more confident.
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Exploring and analysing the cancer genome atlas breast cancer database (TCGA - BRCA), defining neutrophil signature, finding vesiculation markers (Rabs), linking it all on pathways.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... To get familiar with R and Phyton language, while using R studio to cross Rab genes with breast cancer samples. Learning to do a matriz and heatmap.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Breast cancer, extracellular vesicles, neutrophil research.
